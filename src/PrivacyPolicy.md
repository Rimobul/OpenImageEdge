# ImageMenu privacy policy

The **Image Menu** for Microsoft Edge does not collect, store or process any personal information. The only exception to this rule is the locale (language) settings of the Microsoft Edge browser. The **Image Menu** extension accesses the language settings in order to choose the correct translation. However, the language settings are accessed only locally and the information is not propagated further.
